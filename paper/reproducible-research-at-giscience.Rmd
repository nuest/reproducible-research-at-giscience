abstract: |
  Authors of papers at the GIScience conference face challenges of computational reproducibility just like any other discipline using computers to analyse data. In this work, we apply a rubric for assessing the reproducibility to XX conference papers published at the GIScience conference series in years 20XX-2018. The rubric was originally developed for an assessment of publications at the AGILE conference. The results of the GIScience paper assessment are in line with previous findings. The description of workflows and publication of data and software used in most papers suffice to explain the presented work, but are far from enabling a reproduction by a third party with reasonable effort. We summarise and adapt previous recommendations for improving this dire picture and invite the GIScience community to start a broad discussion on reusability, quality, and openness of its research. All material and code of this work is published openly under Zenodo DOI here.
